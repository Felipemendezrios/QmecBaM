# Qmec_BaM
Qmec is a physically based, fully nonlinear, and nonstead reach-averaged river model to provide instantaneous freshwater discharge rates in tidal rivers using water level measurements alone at two tide gauge stations (https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JC015992). This version is enhanced by the inclusion of associated uncertainties during calibration
