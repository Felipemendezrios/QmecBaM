Felipe MENDEZ, Clara CHABRILLANGEAS, Benjamin RENARD, Jérôme LE COZ (INRAE, RiverLy and RECOVER). November 2024. Acknowledgement to Pascal MATTE (Enviroment Canada) and  Daniel BOURGAULT (UQAR, Canada) for developing [Qmec](https://codeocean.com/capsule/8881837/tree/v2), as well as for their support and collaboration throughout this project.

# Introduction
Qmec is a physically based, fully nonlinear, and nonstead reach-averaged river model to provide instantaneous freshwater discharge rates in tidal rivers using water level measurements alone at two tide gauge stations developed by [Bourgault, D., & Matte P.(2021)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JC015992). This version is enhanced by the incorporation of associated uncertainties during calibration and simulation, achieved using Bayesian estimation, as practically applied by [BaM!](https://github.com/BaM-tools/BaM)
