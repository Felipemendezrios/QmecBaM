Description: Qmec is a physically based, fully nonlinear, and nonstead reach-averaged river model
	to provide instantaneous freshwater discharge rates in tidal rivers using water level measurements
	alone at two tide gauge stations.
	This model was developed by Bourgault, D., & Matte P. (2021) <https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JC015992>,
	and its main code is published here: <https://codeocean.com/capsule/8881837/tree/v2>.
	This version is enhanced by the incorporation of associated uncertainties during calibration and simulation,
	achieved using Bayesian estimation, as practically applied by BaM!.
