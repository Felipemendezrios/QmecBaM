Explanation of data raw:

Three MATLAB scripts are provided in the folder to reproduce the results using the input data required for 
Qmec (a MATLAB solver), which is available here:https://codeocean.com/capsule/8881837/tree/v2 

Input data:
- Water level during 1962_2019 at two gauge stations (Neuville, upstream and Lauzon, downstream).
- ADCP discharge observations in 2018 at several stations: Batiscan (cross-section: A), Grondines (B),
 Deschambault (C), Pontneuf (D), Neuville (E), Saint-Nicolas (F) and Quebec (G). 

Please to understand cross-section definition during gauging campaigns,
